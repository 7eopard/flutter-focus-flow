Welcome! This guide will help you get the most out of your new focus tool.

## How to Use (Quick Start)

1.  **Set a Time (Optional):** Click the knob on the right to enter adjustment mode. Drag it up or down to set a goal. Click it again to confirm.
2.  **Press Start:** Begin your focus session. The timer will count up.
3.  **Take a Break:** When you've focused long enough (your goal is met), the main button will change. **Long-press** it to start your earned break.

That's it! For a deeper dive into what makes this timer special, read on.

## Key Features

This timer is designed to adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.

### Minimum Focus Goal & Earned Breaks

Instead of a rigid timer that interrupts you, you set a **Minimum Focus Goal**. The timer counts *up*, showing your progress towards that goal.

Your break time is **earned** based on how long you focus (1 minute of break for every 5 minutes of focus). This encourages you to continue if you're in a state of flow, rewarding you with a longer rest.

### The Adjustment Knob

Before starting, you can fine-tune the timer. Click the textured knob on the right side of the dial to activate adjustment mode. Then, drag the knob up or down (or use your scroll wheel) to add or subtract time. Click the knob again to confirm.

For a pro-move, **drag the knob over the "Set Goal & Break" area** that appears at the bottom. This immediately locks in your total focus time as the new goal and starts your earned breakâ€”perfect for wrapping up a task.

### Dual-View "Glance" Feature

The timer has two powerful views, switched using the second button in the control panel.

-   **Digital View (Default):** The ring shows your progress towards your focus goal (e.g., a full circle is 25 minutes). This answers: *"How far am I through my task?"*
-   **Analog View:** The ring shows a real 60-minute clock. This answers: *"What time will it be when I'm done?"*

**Interaction:**
-   **Click:** Temporarily "glance" at the other view for 4 seconds.
-   **Long Press:** Permanently switch your default view.

### Zen Mode

For maximum focus, activate Zen Mode (the circle icon). This hides all controls, leaving only the essential time display. To temporarily see the controls again, just click anywhere on the screen.

### Interference Levels

This setting (the wave icon) controls how the app notifies you. Vibration is always on.

-   **Zero:** Absolutely no sound.
-   **Weak:** Subtle, gentle chimes for goals.
--   **Strong:** More prominent alerts and system notifications.

## Legacy Phone Mode

For a radically different, distraction-free experience, try the Legacy Phone Mode. Enable it in `Settings > Advanced Options`.

This mode transforms the app into a simple, text-based interface reminiscent of an early 2000s feature phone. It's designed for digital detox, removing all modern graphical elements to help you focus.

### Special Features of Legacy Mode

-   **Granular Animation Control:** In the legacy settings, you can set the "Animation FPS" (Frames Per Second).
    -   **`1` to `8`:** A running block animation.
    -   **`0`:** Disables the animation completely and shows a static text status ("Counting..." or "Paused").
    -   **`-1`:** Enables a classic, blinking colon effect in the timer display.
-   **Multi-Stage Overtime Bar:** If you focus longer than your goal, a secondary progress bar appears. This bar visually evolves as you complete multiple overtime cycles, filling up with different block characters (`â–”`, `â–€`, `â–ˆ`) to mark each milestone. After 400%, the final block lights up in the theme color as a special reward.
-   **Customizable Fonts:** Choose between a classic **Serif** or a clean **Sans-serif** font to customize the timer's appearance.

## Settings Explained

Access these by clicking the gear icon.

-   **Minimum Focus Time:** Set your default goal for each session. The input field will now show a placeholder and won't auto-fill a "1" when cleared, making single-digit entries easy.
-   **Theme & Language:** Customize the app's appearance.
-   **Default Timer View:** Start in **Stopwatch** (counting up) or **Countdown** mode.
-   **Movement Type & Style:** In Analog View, choose the clock's mechanism (e.g., **Quartz Tick** or **Mechanical Sweep**).
-   **Goal Markers:** Display smaller milestones on the timer ring.
-   **Advanced Options:** Here you can enable **Legacy Phone Mode** and adjust other expert settings like the **Anti-Burn-In Interval** for OLED screens.

## Advanced Task Management

Our to-do list is designed to handle real-world complexity, helping you break down work and manage dependencies as they arise.

### Subtasks

Break down large, complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
-   **To Add:** Hover over any task and click the "add subtask" icon (`+`) that appears.
-   **Behavior:** The parent task's completion status is linked to its subtasks. Completing all subtasks will automatically complete the parent. Completing the parent will complete all its children.

### Linking Tasks (Prerequisites)

If one task can't start until another is finished, you can link them.
-   **To Link:** Hover over the task that is blocked and click the link icon (ðŸ”—). A modal will appear, allowing you to select one or more tasks that must be completed first.
-   **Behavior:** A task with prerequisites will be marked with a lock icon (ðŸ”’) and cannot be started. Once all its prerequisite tasks are marked as "done," it will automatically unlock and become available.

### Archiving

Keep your active list clean and focused without losing your work history.
-   **To Archive:** Hover over any task and click the archive icon (a box with a down-arrow). This will move the task and all of its subtasks out of the main view.
-   **To View:** Click the "Show Archived" button at the bottom of the task list to see all your archived items. You can restore them from this view.
